# STL-files

STL files I am scattering across the net, think more people should do this. Some files within have been taken down on serveral sites do to "copy right strikes" but i believe in freedom of information, and i consider this part of that! Most of these files are not partically useful, but also shouldnt be lost forever if these sites keeping getting away with s**t and deleting everything.
